What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

a .git folder is created.  To begin the version control process.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository?

What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains files to be part of the next commit, the
working directory is just the files in the directory.

The staging area allows the user to specify which files they want
version tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

By running git diff --staging you can verify the amount of change in a 
file ready for commit.
